    <p>Before diving into using any framework or tool, one has to ask the important question:</p>
    <h3>WHY?!</h3>
    <p>RequireJS has two distinct primary functions:
        <ul>
            <li>Dependency resolution</li>
            <li>Script loading</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>A secondary function can be argued as one of compartmentalisation, such that javascript modules
        cannot interfere with each other. The importance of each of these functions varies between scenarios
        and it would be difficult to argue which way is &quot;The Bestâ„¢&quot;</p>
    <p>For example, one could use the rather low-tech option of correctly ordering script tags to ensure that
        dependencies are correctly resolved and to handle clashes. But this strategy starts to become more and more
        painful the larger your system gets</p>
    <p>You can also use &quot;Poor Man's Namespaces&quot; to keep your code from clashing, for example:</p>
    <pre data-no-run="true">
window.SomeNamespace = window.SomeNamespace || {};
(function(ns) {
    ns.someFunction = function() {
    };
})(window.SomeNamespace);
    </pre>
    <p>Which also works, but takes a bit of maintenance. None of these methods provide a bulletproof way to handle
        dependencies though, which is why a lot of legacy scripts are loaded after JQuery, for instance, and
        actual logic is only invoked inside a block like:</p>
    <pre data-no-run="true">
$(document).ready(function() {
    // do your magic here
});
    </pre>
    <p>And this is open to strange timing conditions as and when the order of execution of these blocks is
        changed, eg when changing where a script block is inserted in the containing document. And of course, this
        method relies on the understanding that Javascript files are (traditionally, at least), loaded top-down,
        synchronously so you should be guaranteed that in the following scenario:</p>
    <pre data-no-run="true">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/dependency.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    <p><code>dependency.js</code> is fully loaded before <code>main.js</code> is introduced to the DOM, meaning
        that if <code>main.js</code> depends on some exported function in <code>dependency.js</code>, it will run.</p>
    <p>The problem with that is, of course, that users are impatient. They don't want to wait for synchronous 
        downloading of large amounts of data. Newer browsers respect the <code>async</code> attribute on 
        a script tag to make script loading more performant, but then we're back in the boat of trying to resolve
        dependency resolution</p>
    <p>Other methods for resolving dependencies include the AngularJS way, which works perfectly well
        as long as you have
        taken care of script loading already (either through manual script tags, AMD or some kind of bundling / 
        minification process).</p>
